        <h4><b>Back Ground</b></h4>
        <p>
          I was born in Mexico and lived there until I was
          6 years old. My family decided to move to the US
          because we are from a small little town where there
          is a lot of violence and not many jobs. My parents
          wanted a better future for us kids so we moved here 
          January 2000.
